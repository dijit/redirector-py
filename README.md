this project was to learn about WSGI, rivr and redis in python.

I wanted to create something I could use, so here it is.

an Admin interface is being developed and for right now there is no central config for redis (it's hard coded).

redis entries should be in the form of Key: $site, Value: destination (including http://)

I'm open to criticism and bugs.
